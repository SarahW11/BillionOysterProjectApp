            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All too often, we forget about the other organisms that share the world 

with us, one of these being oysters. The NYC harbors were once stocked full 

of oyster reefs that benefitted ecosystems and people alike. Across the Hudson 

River 220,000 acres were covered in oyster reefs; one oyster alone can 

filter 50 gallons of water a day. With more oysters present, we have a natural 

combatance against pollutants and aquatic disasters. Without oysters our harbors are lacking filteration and loosing a fundamental building block in the ecosystem.Luckily, we have the 

<a href="http://www.billionoysterproject.org">Billion Oyster Project</a> that seeks to fix the current situation many harbors face 

with their lack of oysters by re-implementing them back into our waters. They 

need your help to reach their goal!
